The molecule is a diaryl ketone (a benzophenone-type structure) in which one side of the carbonyl is a fused benzodioxepin system and the other side is an ortho‑fluorophenyl ring.

First construct the fused ring system. Make an aromatic benzene ring (Ring A) containing six carbon atoms and label them A1–A6 consecutively around the ring. The bond between A1 and A2 is the fusion edge to a second ring.

Now fuse to that A1–A2 edge a seven‑membered heterocycle (Ring B) that contains two oxygen atoms and three saturated methylene carbons. Ring B shares the two adjacent carbons A1 and A2 with Ring A, so the remaining five atoms of Ring B are: two oxygens (label them Oa and Ob) and three methylene carbons (label them B2, B3, B4). Trace Ring B from A2 to A1 (avoiding the direct A2–A1 bond) as follows: A2 is single‑bonded to oxygen Oa; Oa is single‑bonded to methylene B2; B2–B3–B4 are three consecutive single‑bonded –CH2– units; B4 is single‑bonded to oxygen Ob; and Ob is single‑bonded back to A1. The shared A1–A2 bond remains part of the aromatic benzene ring (and thus provides the only unsaturation within the seven‑membered ring segment).

Next, attach the ketone. On Ring A, take carbon A5 (reached when moving from A2 → A3 → A4 → A5) and bond it to a carbonyl carbon K1. K1 is double‑bonded to an oxygen atom Ok (the ketone oxygen) and single‑bonded to A5 and to a second aryl ring.

Finally, build the second aryl ring (Ring C) as a phenyl ring of six carbon atoms labeled P1–P6, with P1 being the carbon directly bonded to the carbonyl carbon K1. Place a fluorine atom on P2, the carbon adjacent (ortho) to P1; all other positions on this phenyl ring are unsubstituted.
